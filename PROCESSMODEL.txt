In this online auction system the main process model we emply is the waterfall mode.
The waterfall model bascially can be defined as-
	The waterfall model, sometimes called the classic life cycle, suggests a systematic,
sequential approach to software development that begins with customer specification
of requirements and progresses through planning, modeling, construction, and
deployment, culminating in ongoing support of the completed software.

The main reason for choosing the waterfall process odel would be becaause the requirements for a problem are well understood—when
work flows from communication through deployment in a reasonably linear fashion.
The requirement of the system are already well defined as stated in our use 
case diagrams etc.Also, the only disadvantage of using the disadvantage of the process
model is that the software won't be available till late in the development phase, but it is 
okay since we are only delivering one increment of our sopftware after extensive tesing.
// I am planning to add the waterfall odel picture and the v model picture below it in the book software engineering by 
Roger S Pressman 7th Edition pg 39-40.
