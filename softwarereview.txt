After completion of the online auction system, this is how we propose someone on a higher level than us 
should review our project-
 what is a software review?
	In the terms of Roger S. Pressman it is a group of diverse people-
	1. Trying to improve the software by giving suggestions of additions in the software that 
	appeal to them more.
	2. Confirm those parts of the software that are not needed or can be removed.
	3. Achieve technical work of more uniform, or at least more predictable, quality than can be
	achieved without reviews, in order to make technical work more manageable.
Reviewing the defect amplification will be the best way, because it not only tells us about the errors but
also about the things that effected by the changes in our code and how adversely they get effected is also 
important.
Thus the best way to review our model would be the defect amplification.
