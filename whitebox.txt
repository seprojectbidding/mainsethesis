White Box Testing-
	also known as Clear Box Testing, Open Box Testing, Glass Box Testing, Transparent Box Testing
 Code-Based Testing or Structural Testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure
/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester. The tester chooses inputs to 
exercise paths through the code and determines the appropriate outputs. Programming know-how and the 
implementation knowledge is essential.White box testing is testing beyond the user interface and into
the nitty-gritty of a system.
Applying the white box testing to the Bidding module-
	In our bidding module we can have many paths as already seen in the code along with the activity
diagram ,the sequence diagram , the level 2 dfd and the use cases.

EXPLORING ALL THE POSSIBLE PATHS OF THE MODULE			-	EXPECTED OUTPUT			-	RESULT
User enters the module but doesn't like anything and exits	-	no message displayed		-	Executed sucessfully
User enters the module and bids on a specific item and exits	-	message depends on result	-	Executed sucessfully
Bid is countered by a higher bid and the user loses		-	lost bid message 		-	Executed sucessfully
User comes online and bids again rather than losing		-	bid completed message		-	Executed sucessfully
User wins straightaway from the first bid itself		-	bid won message			-	Executed sucessfully
User wins but exits from the third party payment app		-	payment failed message		-	Executed sucessfully
User pays the money and gets the payment deducted		-	payment successful message	-	Executed sucessfully


Above are all the possible paths the user can take in the given module.
Each of these paths were checked and there is no error found in the specific module.
