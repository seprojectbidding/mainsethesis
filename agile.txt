In our project which is Online Auction System, the Scrum framework can be applied suitably.
Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems,
while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
In this, small working teams are organized to "maximize communication, minimize overhead,
and maximize the strength of sharing tacit and informal knowledge. Often thought of as an agile project management framework,
Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work. 
There are various prerequisites for choosing scrum. This employs a backlog in which there is a list of project requirements
that provide buisness value. Items can be added anytime. This makes it customer friendly.
The specifications are already taken care of in the functional requirements and the use cases, but if there are any additional
features, they can always be added in the list of backlog.
The heart of Scrum is a Sprint,
a time-box of two weeks or one month during which a potentially releasable product increment is created. 
A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint. 
During this time, the backlog items that the sprint work units address are frozen. All the data from the use cases 
are implemented here.
Meetings are organized in which the modules of the system can be looked into. After the completion of every backlog,
the next accomplishments of the backlog list is discussed. For example, after the completion of the login() module,
a scrum meeting can be held.
The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.
In this meeting, the Scrum Team is to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the subsequent Sprint.
