Cocomo (Constructive Cost Model) is a regression model based on LOC, i.e number of Lines of Code.
It is a procedural cost estimate model for software projects and often used as a process of reliably
predicting the various parameters associated with making a project such as size, effort, cost, time 
and quality.It was proposed by Barry Boehm in 1970 and is based on the study of 63 projects, 
which make it one of the best-documented models.

COCOMO for the project -
	 The project, though not fully developed is estimated to have around 2000 LOC(Lines Of Codes).
The project is to be completed by two people in two years as the deadline/max time allocated.This 
comes out to be 48 person-months.The type of modelling that would suit the given case is assumed to be
the organic model as the team size is relatively small and the team members have a normal experience
regarding the problem.
	We are delivering the basic COCOMO model as the details are still not completely figured out.
Now, according to Boehm, the cost estimation of effort in a basic organic COCOMO model can be done by the
formula -
	   E= a(KLOC)^b
	 where a and b are constants having the values, a=2.4 and b=1.05
Therefore the estimated cost for the above project comes out to be,
	   E=  4.969 rupees

The effort is measured in Person-Months and as evident from the formula is dependent on Kilo-Lines of code.
These formulas are used as such in the Basic Model calculations, as not much consideration of different factors
such as reliability, expertise is taken into account, henceforth the estimate is rough
