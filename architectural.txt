In this project for the online auction system, we try to find  an appropriate architectural style,one which
suits the requirements of this model. Now in our system, we want that as soon as user gets one item(i.e. buys 
or bids on a particular item), then the details of the same should be visible as changes to the database as
soon as possible and also visible to all the other potential buyers and the seller himself. For this 
major requirement, we think that the data centered architectural style fits well as it is a blackboard mechanism 
for each of the users(read customers) be it a buyer or a seller.
Data Centered Architecture-
A data store (e.g., a file or database) resides at the center of this architecture and is accessed frequently by 
other components that update, add, delete, or otherwise modify data within the store. Figure 9.1 illustrates
a typical data-centered style. Client software accesses a central repository.
In some cases the data repository is passive. That is, client software accesses the data
 independent of any changes to the data or the actions of other client software. 

Any one of them can update the value of the price of bid or purchase the item at once, at no time can
two user buy the same at once which is exaclty what we need.

Organization and Refinement-
		Control-
			In our particular module, the bidding module, the control hierarchy
 exists as admin is at the top of the hierarchy and then it is followed by the buyer and then 
the seller.It implies that the hierarchy looks somewhat like this-
		accept the bid in the admin
		  ^	
		  |
		check in database for availability
		  ^  
		  |
		bid/buy 
	Data- 
		The communication of data is done through the blackboard echansim as stated in the above architectural 
style.
