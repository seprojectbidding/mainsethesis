UI DESIGN (FACTORS):
Design is very important for any project. In this project of online auction, 
there are three golden rules which are followed to accomplish this.
•	User in control:
           If the project had to be exported commercially for a
          particular user, then, as a designer, the goal is to simplify the
           mode of interaction. Modes of interaction shouldn’t force a user 
          into unnecessary or undesired actions. The interaction should be
          flexible and straight forward. Since the project requires the customer to interact, 
          the interactions should be undo-able.
•	Reduced user’s memory load:
          The project should remember pertinent user information and and assist the 
          user with an interaction scenario.
•	Consistent interface:
          In this project, customers can buy, sell and bid products. This implies that 
          the interface will acquire information in a consistent order. For example, module name mention in 
          every screen display of the project
